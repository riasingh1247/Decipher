# Decipher
This project, called "Decipher," employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to encrypt text into a sequence of emojis using a user-set password. It then allows decryption by entering the password, revealing the original text.
This text stack showcases web development skills, user interactivity, and basic cryptography principles for secure data transformation.
